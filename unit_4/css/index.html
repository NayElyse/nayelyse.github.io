<p>Fresh & Preserved represents my personal path to transitioning to a Plant-Based Lifestyle while still staying true to the southern roots & traditions I've valued and enjoyed my whole life. This is about exploring a different lifestyle by challenging yourself to think outside the box.</p>

<p>This site will contain other elements that play a factor into this transition including:
<ul>
<li>Eat & Drink</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Fitness</li>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Garden</li>
</ul>
<p>This page is meant to serve many different purposes wih the most important being to help not only myself but anyone else who is trying to make this same transition and isn't exactly sure where or how to start. Fresh & Preserved will contain all the trial and error recipes I come across, the wellness goals I have for myself as well as how I'm working towards acheiving them, and caring for the home and garden - that brings more to the table then most realize at first.
