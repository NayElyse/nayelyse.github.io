	<h1>Fresh &amp; Preserved</h1>
	<h2 id="slogan">- Enjoy the Difference -</h2>
	<p>Fresh &amp; Preserved represents my personal path to transitioning to a Plant-Based Lifestyle while still staying true to the southern roots &amp;traditions I've valued and enjoyed my whole life. This is about exploring a different lifestyle by challenging yourself to think outside the box.</p>
	<p>Other elements that will play a factor into this transition include but not limited to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eat &amp; Drink</li>
		<li>Health</li>
		<li>Fitness</li>
		<li>Home</li>
		<li>Garden</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This page is meant to serve many different purposes wih the most important being to help not only myself but anyone else who is trying to make this same transition and isn't exactly sure where or how to start. Fresh &amp; Preserved will contain all the trial and error recipes I come across, the wellness goals I have for myself as well as how I'm working towards acheiving them, and caring for the home and garden - that brings more to the table then most realize at first.</p>
	<h3>Ways to Be Vegan</h3>
	<p>As a beginner in this wonderful world of veganism, many people can get lost and would have no clue where to start with transitioning to a healthy, plant-based lifestyle. But there's not just one way to be vegan, there are a variety of different ways a person can be vegan.</p>
	<p>Let me explain. If the definition of vegan is to eat or behave in a manner that causes zero animal suffering, then it's nearly impossible for the average city dwelling person to be 100% vegan. Now before everyone starts freaking out or criticizing me, take tires as an exmaple. There are animal products in them, does that mean you will no longer ride in a car? There shouldn't be a "qualifications" list that a person must pass in order to be vegan. That would make veganism a real hardship that would ulimately severely limit the number of people who could adopt this lifestyle.(Read More)</p>
	<h3>Your Vegan Pantry</h3>
	<p>Many people often wonder what vegans eat. Some people struggle with no longer eating meat, dairy, eggs and honey from their meals as many grocery stores don't offer as many vegan products. But don't panic thinking you can no longer have junk food, there are junk food vegans but that doesn't mean they're eating the healthiest foods.</p>
	<p>This list is to help you get started with stocking your new healthy vegan pantry. Please note this is just an example and by no means is the correct or best but it helped me get a good start on going vegan. (Read More)</p>
