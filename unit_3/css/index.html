<p>Fresh & Preserved represents my personal path to transitioning to a Plant-Based Lifestyle while still staying true to the southern roots & traditions I've valued and enjoyed my whole life. This is about exploring a different lifestyle by challenging yourself to think outside the box.</p>

<p>This site will contain other elements that play a factor into this transition including:
<ul>
<li>Eat & Drink</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Fitness</li>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Garden</li>
</ul>
